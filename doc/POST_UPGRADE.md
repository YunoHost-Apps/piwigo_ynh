## Important: Upgrade your extensions ⚠️

You probably have plugins installed with Piwigo.
Please check your extensions version (plugins, themes, etc.) at <https://__DOMAIN____PATH__/admin.php?page=updates&tab=ext> and upgrade the ones that must be.
Especially that step may be necessary to fix your gallery if it is broken.
